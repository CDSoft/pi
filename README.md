[Post Install] is a set of scripts to complete the installation of several Linux
devices for my personal need.
It can be in some way tuned for other situations.

It configures a fresh minimal Debian installation with I3,
some programming languages and a few other things...

It seems to work on:

- Debian (64 bit)
- Raspbian (on a Raspberry Pi 3) *but still very experimental*

**Caution**: make backups, read carefully and understand the source code before running this script.
You have been warned ;-)

Installation
============

Installation from GitHub:

    git clone https://github.com/CDSoft/pi
    cd pi
    ./pi

Configuration
=============

The configuration file `.pirc` is a single bash script used to configure [Post Install].

Documentation
=============

No documentation written yet. *Use the source, Luke!*
